# PleOps.XdeltaSharp ![Build and release](https://github.com/pleonex/xdelta-sharp/workflows/Build%20and%20release/badge.svg) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/pleonex/xdelta-sharp)

**NOTE: At this stage, this projects can only decompress patch files. It cannot
generate / compress.**

**PleOps.XdeltaSharp** offers the possibility to apply delta/patch files with
format `VCDIFF`, as described in the
[RFC 3284](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3284).

This project offers a library and a console application written in pure C# (no
calls to C libraries). Making it compatible in every OS that can run a .NET
runtime that implements .NET Standard 2.0 (.NET Framework, Mono and .NET).

The project takes the name from [xdelta](https://github.com/jmacd/xdelta).
Another compression tool in C by Joshua MacDonald that implements the algorithm
VCDIFF. It started as a port but due to huge difference between C and C#,
dropped and restarted the development just by reading the specification.

## Limitations

The latest version does not support:

- Generate patch files.
- Patch files with secondary compression. Use the `-S` argument in _xdelta3_.
- Patch files for files bigger or equal to 4 GB.

## Examples

- Apply a patch file

```csharp
using var input = new FileStream(inputFile, FileMode.Open);
using var patch = new FileStream(patchFile, FileMode.Open);
using var output = new FileStream(outputFile, FileMode.Create);

using var decoder = new Decoder(input, patch, output);
decoder.ProgressChanged += progress => Console.WriteLine($"Patching progress: {progress}";

decoder.Run();
```

Feel free to ask any question in the
[project Discussion site!](https://github.com/pleonex/xdelta-sharp/discussions)

Check our on-line [API documentation](https://pleonex.dev/xdelta-sharp/).

## Build

The project requires to build .NET 6.0 SDK and .NET Framework 4.8 or latest
Mono. If you open the project with VS Code and you did install the
[VS Code Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
extension, you can have an already pre-configured development environment with
Docker or Podman.

To build, test and generate artifacts run:

```sh
# Only required the first time
dotnet tool restore

# Default target is Stage-Artifacts
dotnet cake
```

To just build and test quickly, run:

```sh
dotnet cake --target=BuildTest
```
